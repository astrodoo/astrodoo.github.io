About me
===================================

I am a CAS PIFI Fellow Postdoctor working with `Prof. Feng Yuan and his group members`_ at `Shanghai Astronomical Observatory`_.
I truely have diverse interests on astrophysical outflows and their impact on the environment. Currently, I have
been studying theoretically the effects of Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback on the evolution of isolated Early Type Galaxies
considering the galactic rotation and its angular momentum transport outward. Please stay tunned on the progress
of this project. It should be interesting.

I graduated at the `University of Wisconsin-Madison`_, supervised by `Prof. Sebastian Heinz`_.
Using theory and/or numerical simulations, I'd studied the dynamics of (semi-)relativistic 
outflows from compact objects interacting with the interstellar matter. My major interests were
jets from high(low) mass X-ray binaries and bow shock pulsar wind nebulae.

Before starting Phd program in US, as a member of CnTAG, 
I'd studied a gaseous dynamics about barred spiral galaxies
regarding with the effects of self-gravity at the `Seoul National University`_ in South Korea.
This work was supervised by `Prof. Woong-Tae Kim`_.

Outside the research, I love to play any sports especially with ball such as soccer, basket ball, 
tennis, ping-pong, and so on. Also, I like traveling everywhere and playing guitar.
