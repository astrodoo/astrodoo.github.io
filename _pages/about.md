I am a postdoctoral fellow, working with [Prof. Sera Markoff](http://www.seramarkoff.com/) at [Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy](http://api.uva.nl/).

Before the current position,
I was a CAS PIFI Fellow Postdoctor working with [Prof. Feng Yuan and his group members](http://center.shao.ac.cn/fyuan) at [Shanghai Astronomical Observatory](http://english.shao.cas.cn/).
I truely have diverse interests on astrophysical outflows and their impact on the environment. With Prof. Yuan, I have
studied the theoretically the effects of Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback on the evolution of isolated Early Type Galaxies
considering the galactic rotation and its angular momentum transport outward. 

I graduated at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.astro.wisc.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Sebastian Heinz](http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~heinzs).
Using theory and/or numerical simulations, I'd studied the dynamics of (semi-)relativistic 
outflows from compact objects interacting with the interstellar matter. My major interests were
jets from high(low) mass X-ray binaries and bow shock pulsar wind nebulae.

Before starting Phd program in US, as a member of CnTAG at the [Seoul National University](http://astro2.snu.ac.kr/e_main.php) in South Korea, 
I'd studied a gaseous dynamics about barred spiral galaxies
regarding with the effects of self-gravity .
This project was supervised by [Prof. Woong-Tae Kim](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~wkim/).

Outside the research, I love to play any sports especially with ball such as soccer, basket ball, 
tennis, ping-pong, and so on. Also, I like traveling everywhere and playing guitar.
