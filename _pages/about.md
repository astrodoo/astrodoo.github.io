I am a postdoctoral fellow in [Prof. Sera Markoff](http://www.seramarkoff.com/){:target="_blank"}'s group at [Anton Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy](http://api.uva.nl/){:target="_blank"}.
Using GRMHD code _H-AMR_, I've been studying the dynamics of an accretion disk, wind, and jets around black holes. As a member of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project,
I've been participating in the collaborative investigation that explores the nature of supermassive black holes, such as Sgr A* and M87.

Before the current position,
I was a CAS PIFI Fellow Postdoctor working with [Prof. Feng Yuan and his group members](http://center.shao.ac.cn/fyuan){:target="_blank"} at [Shanghai Astronomical Observatory](http://english.shao.cas.cn/){:target="_blank"}.
I truly have diverse interests in astrophysical outflows and their impact on the environment. With Prof. Yuan, I have
studied theoretically the effects of Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback on the evolution of isolated Early Type Galaxies
considering the galactic rotation and its angular momentum transport outward. 

I graduated from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.astro.wisc.edu/){:target="_blank"}, supervised by [Prof. Sebastian Heinz](http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~heinzs){:target="_blank"}.
Using theory and/or numerical simulations, I'd studied the dynamics of (semi-)relativistic 
outflows from compact objects interacting with the interstellar matter. My major interests were
jets from high(low) mass X-ray binaries and bow shock pulsar wind nebulae.

Before starting my Ph.D. program in the US, as a member of CnTAG at the [Seoul National University](http://astro2.snu.ac.kr/e_main.php){:target="_blank"} in South Korea, 
I'd studied gaseous dynamics about barred spiral galaxies
regarding the effects of self-gravity.
This project was supervised by [Prof. Woong-Tae Kim](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~wkim/){:target="_blank"}.

Outside the research, I love to play any sports especially with a ball such as soccer, basketball, 
tennis, ping-pong, and so on. Also, I like traveling everywhere and playing guitar.
